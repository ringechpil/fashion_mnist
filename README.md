# fashion_mnist


We build and compare several CNN architectures by training and testing them on Fashion-MNIST dataset for clothing objects classification. 



| Model  | Train Set Acc. | Test Set Acc. | Run Time/Epoch |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Shallow Net  | 97.6% | 92.5% | 40s |
| Shallow Net (aug) | 94.9% | 92.6% | 60s |
| LeNet5 | 96.3% | 91.1% | 30s |
| Slow Net | 93.9% | 93% | 570s |



1째 Homemade Shallow Net: A very simple CNN with a bit of regularization. Gives the best accuracy score on the train set.

1.5째 Shallow Net with augmentation: Gives less overfit. Maybe not the best augmentation parameter setting. But, with more experience, I'd probably get the better feeling for the augmentation parameter tuning, and get better results. 

2째 LeNet5: Quick simple (and famous) architecture. Gives the lowest test score, but it's fastest to train.

3째 Slow Net: A bit bigger network, gives the highest test score, no overfit, but it's very slow to train (on CPU).


For more detailed analyses, please refer to the individual notebook files. I also tried to write a demo program for object detection/classification, but I couldn't complete it. However, I left a blueprint, which hopefully I'll be able to fill in, once I gain enough practical experience.
